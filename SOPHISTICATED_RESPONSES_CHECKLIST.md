## Usage Quick Reference

### Minimal Setup (Auto-enhanced)
```python
from local_ai_response import LocalAIResponse
ai = LocalAIResponse()
response = ai.generate("your query")
# Automatically includes thinking traces and structure
```

### With Configuration
```python
ai.use_structured_reasoning = True
ai.expertise_level = "advanced"
ai.max_response_length = 4000
response = ai.generate("complex query")
```

### Direct Engine Usage
```python
from modules.sophisticated_responses import SophisticatedResponseEngine
engine = SophisticatedResponseEngine()
response = engine.synthesize_response(brain_state, user_input, content)
```

### Advanced Formatting
```python
from modules.advanced_response_formatter import AdvancedResponseFormatter, ResponseStyle
formatter = AdvancedResponseFormatter()
formatted = formatter.format_with_thinking(
    user_input, response_content, thinking_process, ResponseStyle.EDUCATIONAL
)
```
