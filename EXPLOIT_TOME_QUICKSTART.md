# 📚 Exploit Tome - Quick Start Guide

The **Exploit Tome** is a centralized repository for managing, organizing, and tracking all active/working exploits. It provides full metadata tracking, execution history, collections, and statistics.

## Features

### 1. **Active Exploits View**
- Browse all exploits in a table with filtering
- Search by name, category, or target
- Filter by status (active, archived, testing) and category
- View detailed exploit information and payload
- Color-coded success rates

### 2. **Add/Edit Exploits**
- Create new exploit entries with full metadata
- Store payload code with syntax highlighting
- Add CVE IDs, references, and tags
- Include notes and descriptions
- Edit existing exploits

### 3. **Statistics Dashboard**
- Overall summary statistics
- Exploits by category breakdown
- Exploits by status distribution
- Top performing exploits ranked by success rate
- Overall success rate tracking

### 4. **Collections**
- Organize exploits into custom collections
- Group related exploits together
- Add exploits to multiple collections
- View all exploits in a collection

### 5. **Execution History**
- Track every execution attempt for each exploit
- View timestamp, target, result, and response
- Automatically updates success/failure counts
- Persistent history for analysis

### 6. **Export/Import**
- Export all exploits to JSON backup
- Export individual exploits
- Import exploits from JSON files
- Share exploit databases across systems

**Add Exploit to Collection:**
1. Select an exploit from the list
2. Choose collection from dropdown
3. Click **"➕ Add Selected Exploit"**

### Viewing Statistics

1. Go to the **"📊 Statistics"** tab

   - Top performing exploits
3. Click **"🔄 Refresh Statistics"** to update

### Viewing Execution History

1. Select an exploit from the list
2. Go to the **"⏱️ Execution History"** tab
3. View all execution attempts with timestamps and results

### Backup & Restore

**Export All Exploits:**
1. Click **"📤 Export All"** button
2. Choose filename and location
3. Exploits saved as JSON

**Import Exploits:**
1. Click **"📥 Import from JSON"**
2. Select previously exported JSON file
3. Exploits loaded into Tome

## Exploit Entry Fields

| Field | Required | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Name | Yes | "Struts2 RCE" |
| Category | Yes | "Remote Code Execution" |
| Target URL | Yes | "http://target.com/action.php" |
| Payload | Yes | `curl -X POST -d 'cmd=id' http://target.com` |
| Notes | No | "Works on unpatched versions" |
| CVE IDs | No | CVE-2023-XXXXX, CVE-2023-YYYYY |
| References | No | https://exploit-db.com/... |
| Tags | No | "critical, wordpress, 2024" |

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
   - Good: "WordPress Plugin SQL Injection (CVE-2024-1234)"
   - Bad: "vuln1", "test", "works"

2. **Categories**: Keep consistent category names
   - Suggested: SQL Injection, RCE, XSS, CSRF, Deserialization, etc.

3. **Payloads**: Include full working code
   - Document any dependencies
   - Include parameter names
   - Add comments if complex

4. **Tracking**: Update notes after each execution
   - Document what worked and what didn't
   - Track environment-specific variations
   - Note patches that defeat the exploit

5. **Organization**:
   - Use tags for quick filtering
   - Create collections for campaigns
   - Archive old exploits instead of deleting

## Database Location

The Exploit Tome uses SQLite database:
- **Default location**: `exploit_tome.db` (in HadesAI directory)
- Automatically created on first use
- Can be backed up and restored via JSON export/import

## Integration with Other Features

### With Learned Exploits Tab
- Learned exploits can be manually added to Tome
- Provides more structured storage than default learning

### With Exploit Seek Tab
- Found exploits can be saved to Tome
- Track and manage discovered vulnerabilities

### With Simulations
- Test Tome exploits against simulated environments
- Verify exploit effectiveness safely

## API Usage (Python)

You can also interact with the Tome programmatically:

```python
from exploit_tome import ExploitTome, ExploitEntry

# Initialize
tome = ExploitTome("exploit_tome.db")

# Add exploit
exploit = ExploitEntry(
    id="test_001",
    name="Test Exploit",
    category="SQL Injection",
    target="http://target.com/vulnerable.php",
    payload="' OR '1'='1",
    notes="Test payload"
)
tome.add_exploit(exploit)

# Get all exploits
exploits = tome.get_all_exploits()

# Search
results = tome.search_exploits("sql")

# Log execution
tome.log_execution("test_001", "http://target.com", "success")

# Get statistics
stats = tome.get_statistics()

# Export
tome.export_to_json("backup.json")
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Exploit Tome tab not appearing?**
A: Make sure `exploit_tome.py` and `exploit_tome_gui.py` are in the HadesAI directory

**Q: Changes not saving?**
A: Check file permissions for `exploit_tome.db` database file

**Q: Can't import JSON file?**
A: Ensure JSON format matches export structure with `exploits` array

**Q: Performance slow with many exploits?**
A: Try archiving old exploits to reduce active set

## Future Enhancements

- Automated exploit testing against targets
- Integration with vulnerability scanners
- Machine learning exploit ranking
- Automated backup to cloud
- Team collaboration features
- REST API for remote access
