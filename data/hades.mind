The `--` comments out the password check, granting access.\n\nTypes of SQL injection:\n- Classic: Direct insertion into query.\n- Blind: No error messages, but data can still be extracted.\n- Time-based: Delays in response reveal data.\n\nPrevention?

For context, the English language alone has over a million words. Multiply that by the thousands of languages and dialects, and the number of possible words becomes unfathomable.\n\nBut let's play with numbers. Suppose the \"Book of Everything\" contains every possible word in every language, with an average word length of 5 letters. The number of possible 5-letter combinations in the English alphabet is 26^5, which is about 11.8 million. Multiply that by the number of languages and dialects, and the number of words could easily exceed a quadrillion.\n\nSo, the \"Book of Everything\" would likely contain more words than there are stars in the observable universe.
