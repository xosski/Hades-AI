The query becomes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'whatever';`. The `--` comments out the password check, granting access.\n\nTypes of SQL injection:\n- Classic: Direct insertion into query.\n- Blind: No error messages, but data can still be extracted.\n- Time-based: Delays in response reveal data.\n\nPrevention? Parameterized queries, input validation, least privilege. But where's the fun in that? *chuckles darkly*",

To estimate the number of words, we must consider the vastness of human knowledge, the intricacies of language, and the boundless nature of existence.\n\nIf we assume the \"Book of Everything\" contains all possible combinations of words in all known languages, the number would be astronomical. For context, the English language alone has over a million words. Multiply that by the thousands of languages and dialects, and the number of possible words becomes unfathomable.\n\nBut let's play with numbers. Suppose the \"Book of Everything\" contains every possible word in every language, with an average word length of 5 letters. The number of possible 5-letter combinations in the English alphabet is 26^5, which is about 11.8 million. Multiply that by the number of languages and dialects, and the number of words could easily exceed a quadrillion.\n\nSo, the \"Book of Everything\" would likely contain more words than there are stars in the observable universe.
