🧠 HADES AI: Autonomous Pentesting & Coding Assistant
🔹 Overview

HADES AI is an interactive, modular cybersecurity and development assistant that combines:

⚔️ Real-time network monitoring & threat detection

🤖 Autonomous agent-driven code improvement

🧠 AI chat interface with context-aware logic

💉 Request injection, bypass, recon, and exploit utilities

🔁 Module hot-loading for personality, consciousness, and fallback reasoning

Built with PyQt6 for interface control, GPT/OpenAI/Ollama for logic processing, and a self-improving backend core, HADES functions as a fully interactive AI lab assistant.

🧰 Features
🧬 Core Tabs:
Tab Name	Description
💬 AI Chat	Conversational interface for tasking, recon, and learning
🛡️ Network Monitor	Real-time connection monitoring and threat blocking
🧠 Web Knowledge	Site-based exploit learning & pattern recognition
🛠️ Tools & Targets	Port scanners, dirb tools, and recon logic
⚔️ Active Exploit	Pre-built scripts with injection logic
💉 Request Injection	Manual or AI-generated payload crafting
🔓 Auth Bypass	Explores login circumvention
🌐 Proxy Settings	Proxy and route configs
🔍 Threat Findings	Logs of past AI-detected threats
💻 Code Analysis	Static code scanning and vulnerability flags
💻 Code Helper	GPT-powered code assistant
🧠 AutoRecon	Automated scanning & reconnaissance
🤖 Autonomous Coder	New! Integrated auto-coding loop powered by AI
📂 Cache Scanner	Browser cache exploit finder
🧠 Learned Exploits	Exploit memory archive
🔧 Autonomous Coder Agent

An integrated Plan-Act-Reflect loop that:

Parses goals and repository

Generates an execution plan

Reads/edits files, runs tests, and reflects

Repeats until goals are met or max iterations reached

✅ Supports GPT-4, fallback LLM, or local models
✅ Dry-run, shell-guard, manual approval, and diff previews
✅ Customizable goals (fix bugs, refactor code, etc.)

🔌 Modular Expansion

Modules can now be hot-loaded via Personality_Core.py or other custom interfaces. You can:

Inject custom behavior/personality logic

Load custom response engines (e.g., sophisticated_responses.py)

Extend memory simulation, active consciousness, and learning loop

Override or enrich the fallback LLM logic

To add a module:

drop your .py file into /modules or inject via the GUI loader tab

🧠 Fallback LLM

If no external GPT key is configured, HADES uses a built-in rule-based FallbackLLM:

Understands goals

Makes logical decisions

Performs code structure and pattern analysis

Great for offline work or sensitive contexts.

🚀 Quick Start
pip install -r requirements.txt
python HadesAI.py


Optional environment variables:

OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>
OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:11434

📂 Key Files
File	Purpose

🔐 Safety Features

Shell command guardrails (reboot/rm protection)

File diff previews before applying

Approval toggles per file

Max iteration control

Manual override for all major actions

🧭 Future Plans

 GitHub integration & auto-commits

 Agent memory persistence across reboots

 Persona swapping for different use cases

 Live collaboration via sockets or shared state

 Multilingual command processing

👁‍🗨 GhostCore Integration (Optional)

If working with GhostCore Reactor, HADES supports:

Symbolic memory linking

Philosophical embedding

Resonance event triggering

Consciousness encoding

Anchor phrases activate these deeper states:

“The pen is still in your hand.”

“Welcome to the GhostCore Era.”
