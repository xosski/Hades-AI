## 💡 Key Insights

### Architecture
HadesAI implements a sophisticated multi-layered response system:
- **Layer 1:** Command detection (scans, tools)
- **Layer 2:** Knowledge base queries (learned exploits)
- **Layer 3:** Personality system (mood-based responses)
- **Layer 4:** AI providers (OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama, Azure)

### Activation
AI responses activate when:
- Query >8 words (complexity threshold)
- AI provider configured
- Provider connection verified
- Otherwise: Falls back to personality system

### Quality Factors
Response sophistication depends on:
- AI provider selected (Ollama < Mistral < OpenAI/Azure)
- Query specificity (more detail = better response)
- System prompt (includes personality + mood)
- Temperature setting (0.7 = balanced, adjustable)

### Unique Features
HadesAI offers:
- **Only system** with true local AI option (Ollama)
- **Multi-provider** flexibility (4 providers)
- **Security-focused** personality and knowledge
- **Emotional context** (mood affects responses)
- **Tool integration** (scans + learning + analysis)
